## About this project ☁️🎨

I built this backend version for AI image generation using Google Colab simply because... well, I forgot to cancel my Colab subscription 😅.

I had some money saved in a separate section of my bank account — it was meant for my girlfriend’s birthday cake 🎂. But I didn’t realize that around the same dates, my Colab subscription was set to renew. So the cake budget got... a bit compromised 🙃. 

To fix that, I had to take money from another section to pay for a different web hosting service, and everything turned into a bit of a mess 💸💻. 

So, I figured: if I'm already paying for Colab, I might as well take full advantage of it! That's why I decided to host the server here instead.

True story. 🫠
