# Morafkai: AI Photo Editor 📸✨

A small app that uses artificial intelligence to take photos and transform them — 🤖

Right now it's just the basics:
- A UI where you can pick or take a photo 🖼️
- A backend (hosted with Google Colab) that runs an image generation model 🧠
- A very chaotic but functional connection via ngrok ☁️

The plan? To turn it into a full-featured AI photo editing app. Little by little. Commit by commit. Bug by bug 🐞💥

This repo will keep growing as the project evolves — for now, welcome to the very early stages 👷‍♂️
